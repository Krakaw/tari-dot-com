If you don't already have Jekyll set up, you can find the quick start in the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).


Clone the repo and run `gem install jekyll bundler`

#### Development environment

Run:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_development.yml`
```

It is not required, but to have the GitHub Issues come through during development you can run the GitHub Issues Cache locally.     
Refer [this repo](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-dot-com-issue-cache).
